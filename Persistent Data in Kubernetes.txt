Data Persistence in Kubernetes
==============================

This document explains how Kubernetes can "remember" data over long periods. Kubernetes uses persistent storage to maintain data even if Pods are recreated.

1. **Persistent Volumes (PV)**: Abstraction over physical storage. A cluster administrator creates PVs.
2. **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**: Requests for storage by a Pod or Deployment. When a PVC matches a PV, the storage is bound to the claim.
3. **Storage Classes**: Define how to dynamically provision PVs. Useful in cloud or on-prem environments where you want on-demand storage.
4. **Stateful Sets**: Controller that manages stateful applications. Each pod gets its own persistent volume claim, allowing data to remain available even after restarts.

Example: Using a Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim
--------------------------------------------------------------

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: example-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /data/example
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: example-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: nginx
        volumeMounts:
        - name: storage
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      volumes:
      - name: storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: example-pvc
```

This deployment mounts the storage from `example-pvc`. Even if the Pod restarts, the data in `/usr/share/nginx/html` remains because it lives on the persistent volume.

Use Cases
---------
- Databases like MongoDB or MySQL where data must survive Pod recreation.
- Application logs or uploads that should persist beyond a single Pod lifecycle.
- Any other stateful workload that requires durable storage.
