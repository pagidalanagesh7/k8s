Resource Quotas
===============

--> Resource Quotas in Kubernetes are a mechanism for limiting the resource usage of a namespace. They help ensure fair resource distribution among different teams or applications running in a cluster by enforcing limits on the consumption of resources like CPU, memory, and the number of objects (pods, services, etc.).


Key Concepts of Resource Quotas
-------------------------------
1. Purpose: Resource quotas are primarily used to prevent any single namespace from consuming too many resources and to promote fair resource sharing in multi-tenant environments.

2. Quota Types: You can set quotas for various resources, including:

	CPU: The total CPU resources (in cores) that can be requested by containers in the namespace.

	Memory: The total memory (in bytes) that can be requested by containers.

	Persistent Volumes: The total number of persistent volume claims (PVCs) allowed.

	Pods: The maximum number of pods that can be created in the namespace.

	Services: The maximum number of services that can be created.

3. Limits: Resource quotas can specify both hard limits (maximum resource usage) and soft limits (recommended usage).



EX:
==
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: example-quota
  namespace: test-ns
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "3"
